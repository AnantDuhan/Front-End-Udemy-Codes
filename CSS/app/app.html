            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, <br> originally from Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel;
            <br> a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a termbr <br> only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most
            <br> common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic <br> fowl were typically used for this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, <sup><a href="https://www.google.co.in">[5]</a></sup> but the <br> clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated
            from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient <br> India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE. <sup>[6]</sup> Fowl have been known <br> in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird
            that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria <br> and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>

        <p>
            According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century <br> as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[20][21][22] and is widely used throughout
            North America. <br> "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.

            <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

            <p>
                Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks <br> (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of
                females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, <br> such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made <br> by looking at the comb, or eventually
                from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and <br> female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb,
                and hanging flaps <br> of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. <br> Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but
                in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in <br> several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable
                of <br> long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees <br> (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their
                surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

        <h3>Behaviour</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>

        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual <br> chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant
            individuals having priority for food access and nesting <br> locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. <br> Adding hens, especially younger
            birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[28] When a rooster finds food, he may call other <br> chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour
            may also be observed <br> in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
        </p>

        <p>
            A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[29] However, roosters may also crow <br> in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying
            an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also <br> give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.
