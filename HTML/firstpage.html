                    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
                    fowl, <br>
                    originally from Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a
                    cockerel;<br>
                    a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a
                    termbr <br>
                    only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become
                    the most <br>  
                    common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or
                    domestic <br>
                    fowl were typically used for this.

                <p>
                    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, <sup><a href="https://www.google.co.in">[5]</a></sup>
                    but the <br>
                    clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
                    From ancient <br>
                    India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE. <sup>[6]</sup> Fowl have
                    been known <br>
                    in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the
                    land between Syria <br>
                    and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

                <h2>Etymology</h2>

                <p>
                    According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
                    century <br>
                    as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[20][21][22] and is widely
                    used throughout North America. <br>
                    "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.

                    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

                    <p>
                        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
                        pointed feathers on their necks <br>
                        (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the
                        same breed. However, in some breeds, <br>
                        such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the
                        hen's. The identification can be made <br>
                        by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and
                        in certain hybrids, the male and <br>
                        female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a
                        comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps <br>
                        of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on
                        the head and throat are called caruncles. <br>
                        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
                        A muff or beard is a mutation found in <br>
                        several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a
                        beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of <br>
                        long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as
                        over fences or into trees <br>
                        (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but
                        generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

                <h3>Behaviour</h3>
                <h4>Social behaviour</h4>

                <p>
                    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
                    of eggs and raising of young. Individual <br>
                    chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having
                    priority for food access and nesting <br>
                    locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a
                    new pecking order is established. <br>
                    Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[28] When a
                    rooster finds food, he may call other <br>
                    chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
                    This behaviour may also be observed <br>
                    in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
                    roosters.[29] However, roosters may also crow <br>
                    in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and
                    also to call their chicks. Chickens also <br>
                    give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.
